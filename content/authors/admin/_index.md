I am a 5th year PhD candidate in political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research focuses on elite party networks in US political parties. In short, I study the types of relationships politicians, campaign donors, activists, and interest groups form with one another. More broadly, I am interested in political parties in advanced democracies, community detection in political networks, and campaign finance.

Outside of my work, I enjoy playing hockey, laying on beaches, traveling to new cities, and watching A24 movies.
